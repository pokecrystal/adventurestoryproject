Sara and her Trip to the Pet Store (Adventure Story Project) \\

\Large 
Sara sat at home alone. After an exhausting week at work she lay on her couch watching Netflix and eating Cheetos.As she was stuffing her face full of finger licking goodness, she looked outside her window to see her neighbor, Chris playing ball with his adorable Corgi, Jojo. Jojo hopped back and forth chasing the ball across the green and lush yard. "What as cute pupper.", thought Sara as she walked outside to get a better view of the doggo and its owner enjoying each other's company. As she approached Chris's lawn, Jojo's smile widened and his stubby Corgi tail wagged in happiness as he bumbled over to greet Sara in slobbery kisses and wet licks. In return Sara gave Jojo an enthusiastic belly rub and a couple pats on the head as Jojo's tongue flapped around in enjoyment. Then Sara stood up to talk to Chris. As Sara and Chris discussed their mutual fondness of puppies and pets, Jojo waddles around the lawn runs around the lawn chasing a butterfly that he a seen land on a flower. As a Sara and Chris end their conversation and Sara turns around to head back to her home. Walking home, Sara thought about how great of a companion Jojo was to Chris and right then, at that moment, her mind was set. Sara was going to get a pet to be her loyal friend. But, the question was what type of pet was she going to get? Sara not only loved dogs but she also loved cats. As a child her family had a kitten that Sara loved to play with, and she enjoyed the relaxed personality of cats. As she walked to her car on the way to the pet store, Sara was excited to gain a loyal and lifelong companion.
